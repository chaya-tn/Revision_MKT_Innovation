# Revision_MKT_Innovation

---

- Demonstrate theorical concept in a given innovative situation
- How to apply, what you understand from the case study

---

Innovation = invention that bring commercial value

Product/service innovation: visible by consumer, they can get benefit/value
Process innovation: economic of scale, manufacturer can be transmit and share
Business model innovation: profitable business to maximize value creation

Radical (change the basic principle of the product dramatically ) vs Incremental (improvement of existing solution)
- Techno: skill&resources to develop new innovative product
- Usage*: customer behavior
- BM*: eco-system that will be able to deliver the value proposition

Gourville** = barrier of innovation, psychological aspect of customer's adoption

Cost
- economic cost: learning cost to learn again how to use new products and transaction cost

- psychology cost of adoption*: people are suffering, they need to compare - change
> Gain & losses: the fact that they hate losing (loss aversion) - reference point and overvalue potential gain&losses by fact of three
>>> Endowment effect: 'overvalue' what they currently own, tend to contribute higher value

>>> Status quo bias: stick with what you already owned 'we won't bother changing'

> Customers: trade-offs potential gain and potential losses, when they will be swiching from reference point

> Innovators: they are also suffering, they overvalue potential gain
>>> 9x effect**: mismatch, no matter how good your product is, you will always have 'Resistance' from your customer

**How to build argumentation to justify your choice?**
- Easy sells: easier for customer to imitate, rapid adoption but short-term competitve advantage, many competitors
- Long hauls: (mostly talk about radical innovation),need to wait until the product be adopted, strong resistance, long-term adoption but you can enjoy long-term comptitive advantage
- Smash hits: (also mostly radical innovation) but customer don't need to change much behavior e.g. iPhone

Two way to manage innovative products 
- Accepting: be patient (for ex. )
- Minimizing

Cross the chasm - Mainstream market (the chasm)
'the chasm typically happen in a long hauls, because early adopters are differet from early majority'
= the crack between market and customeres as follows:

- visionary customer*: early adopters // Early Market
= who want the newest things and how they can benefit from this innovative technology e.g. in B2B market
= ready to get risk but they are very demanding customers
= east to sell but hard to please

- pragmatist*: early majority customers // Mainstream Market 
= who want complete solutions and convenience to improve their business, focus on the usage and they are risk-averse
= e.g. B2B can be successful company thus if they need to buy new thing, they will look for just the thing to improve

- conservative: late majority customers // Mainstream Market

**Then how to cross the chasm?**
- why to attack early adopters first, to get first recommendation
- focus initial target market (with compelling reason to buy), start from small market to become dominant player
- develop the whole-products that will facilitate the process of cross the chasm
- define the battle (about competition) what is your differentiation, how you compare to competitors

_Tips_: Explain why chasm is here, who is the visionary in specific example, who are the customer in initial market, what is compelling reason to buy, how to develop the whole-product
e.g. B2C: MP3 player until iPod came

Disruptive Market - LOST (replay  later)
- Disruptive innovation is always radical

Close and open innovation

3 Appraches
- Integrator (close innovation): You do everything by yourself, skills, capabilities & resources are inside the company
they know customer's taste, and you can get long product life cycle
e.g. Polaroid, but the problem is they don't have enough skills and they need to develop this so they need to invest a lot

- Orchestrator (open innovation): when you decide to take care of one part of the business e.g. design, specific know-how and find expert outsourses for another part
e.g. iPhone, they design only the product but hire R&D, suppliers, oursource the manufacturing, then they can just orchestrate the sale

- Licensor (open innovation): license out the idea for the other companies to develop the products e.g. biotechnology, they get the idea launch to the market

Open innovation: 

Business model components:
- Value proposition: To define, you need to list activity design e.g. Netflix = Movie at home
- Activity design: e.g. Netflix = DVD inventory, Independent movies, Stock management, Online DVD rental so you need a website
- Core capabilities: what are you very good at, what is competitive advantage e.g. Netflix = Recommendation system
- Interdependencies: what are other stakeholders who can help you maximize the value creation e.g. Netflix = Invetors, US Postal etc.
- Profit formula: need to balance profit and procurement cost to be profitable in the long term (sustainable BM) e.g. Netflix = monthly subscription
